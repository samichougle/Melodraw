# Melodraw – Drawing Meets Music
## Introduction 
Melodraw is an app that turns drawing into an experience that engages both sight and sound. Brushstroke not only creates a visual design but also plays a unique musical note, making art feel more interactive. Instead of just drawing, users can compose a melody with colors, where each shade represents a different instrument.
The name Melodraw combines "Melody" and "Draw," symbolizing a creative platform that integrates music and visual artistry. This fusion allows users to explore a new way of expression, where art is not only seen but also heard.
## Inspiration
I’ve always been fascinated by both art and music. They are two powerful forms of self-expression, and I wanted to combine them into something that felt fun and intuitive. The idea came from a simple question: What if colors had sound? What if drawing could be more than just a visual activity? This curiosity led me to create Melodraw, where colors don’t just appear on the screen—they also play meaningful sounds that match their energy.
## How It Works
1. Colors That Sound Meaningful
Instead of random notes, I assigned sounds to colors based on the emotions and characteristics of real musical instruments:
 * Purple – Electric Guitar (Bold, powerful, and energetic, like rock music)
 * Brown – Clarinet (Warm and deep, reflecting the natural wood tones of the instrument)
 * Green – Harp (Soothing and calm, representing nature and tranquility)
 * Orange – Violin (Passionate and expressive, like the emotional pull of a violin solo)
 * Yellow – Acoustic Guitar (Bright and cheerful, capturing the uplifting sound of an acoustic guitar)
 * Pink – Flute (Light and playful, just like the delicate notes of a flute)
2. Real-time Sound Feedback
As you draw, you don’t just see colors appear—you hear the sounds immediately, making each stroke feel like part of a song.
3. Undo, Redo, and Clear Canvas
Users can easily undo mistakes, redo strokes, or clear the canvas to start fresh, ensuring a seamless creative process.
4. Share Your Artwork
After finishing a piece, users can save and share their creations with others, making it easy to spread creativity.
## Technologies I Used
* SwiftUI for the drawing interface and user interactions.
* AVFoundation to generate sound effects linked to different colors.
* ImageRenderer to turn the canvas into a shareable image.
* Gesture Recognizers to track drawing movements and trigger sounds in real time.
* UIKit Integration for the share feature, allowing users to send their drawings easily.
## Challenges I Faced
One of the biggest challenges was syncing the sounds with the drawing process in a way that felt natural. If the sounds lagged, it would take away from the experience. To solve this, I optimized how the sounds were loaded and played. Another challenge was making sure each instrument fit the feeling of its color, which took some fine-tuning to get right.
## What Makes Melodraw Special
Most drawing apps focus only on visuals, but Melodraw creates a multisensory experience. By giving colors meaningful sounds, it helps users think about art in a new way—one that connects sight, sound, and creativity. It’s not just about making pictures; it’s about making music with your brush.
## What I Learned
Building Melodraw taught me a lot about combining different technologies, from SwiftUI for drawing to AVFoundation for audio. More importantly, it showed me how creativity and coding can come together to create something that’s both fun and expressive.
## Conclusion
Melodraw is more than just an app—it’s an interactive way to experience creativity through both art and music. By linking colors to meaningful sounds, it allows users to not only see their imagination come to life but also hear it. I hope Melodraw inspires others to explore creativity in new and unexpected ways. Thank you for considering my project!
